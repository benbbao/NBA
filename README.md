NBA Fantasy Assistant will be an application to aid users in selecting the most
statistically opportune players to add to their fantasy basketball team rosters. The
domains of this application will include, but are not limited to, individual players in the
National Basketball Association, the various teams that comprise the NBA, different
seasons, and individual games within a given season. The usefulness of this app will be
most easily utilized by individuals who regularly update and keep track of their fantasy
basketball team rosters. Stats can, and often change daily from game to game as
players go through slumps, injuries, and other extraneous circumstances that affect how
they play. Our app will help users to differentiate who the best players are to add to their
roster in the present moment. The utility of the app is not limited to fantasy basketball
players as users who often bet on NBA games will also find player and team statistics
very useful in determining who and how much money to bet on a certain game, what
kind of spread they might want to use, and which players might outperform the best.
